Initially forged from the [Interactive Python](https://ipython.org) project, [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) is an exciting initiative to support an open standards, language agnostic interactive computing platform where it provides the ideal integrated exploratory programming environment for data science and scientific computing as represented by its 3 core languages for these domains in [Julia](https://julialang.org), [Python](https://python.org) and [R](https://www.r-project.org) (Ju-Py-R).

However its popularity, thriving ecosystem and rich tooling has seen it grow to encompass a wide range of interactive computing use-cases including data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more which now sees it support over 40 programming languages.

### Jupyter Notebooks

At the core of Jupyter is the "Notebook" (Nb) - an open JSON document format that contains a complete record of user's sessions including code, narrative text, equations, visualizations and rich output. The culmination of which facilitates the creation and sharing of Live Executable Documents encapsulating an Interactive computing session that provides an ideal visual REPL environment for exploratory programming whose results and findings can be further annotated with Markdown documentation and exported in a number of formats to facilitate knowledge sharing including: HTML, PDF, Markdown, Latex, ReStructured Text, Asciidoc, Reveal.js.

### Create Python, C# and F# Jupyter Notebooks for any ServiceStack API

By leveraging [Add ServiceStack Reference's](/add-servicestack-reference) rich, typed ecosystem we're able to tap into the exciting interactive world of Jupyter Notebooks where any of your API consumers will easily be able to generate custom-tailored notebooks for any of your APIs using a Simple UI or command-line tools:

## Notebook Apps

The core UX for experiencing Jupyter Notebooks is through a Notebook App which thanks to Jupyter's momentum and vibrant ecosystem there are now many options to choose from, optimizing for different developers use-cases and integrated development workflows.

Delivered and maintained as part of the Jupyter project are 2 self-hosted front-end Web Application UIs for authoring and running Notebooks:

### JupyterLab

JupyterLab is Jupyter's next-gen web-based development environment designed around maintaining an entire Workspace of Notebooks in a multi-tabbed splittable UI whereby many of them can be running at the same time:

An easy way to install JupyterLab is to use the pip package manager installed with Python:

    $ pip install jupyterlab

Once installed you can launch JupyterLab's UI from a directory containing your Notebooks where they'll be accessible from its built-in File Explorer UI:

    $ jupyter-lab

title: File System FileUploadFeature
---

The FileUploadFeature plugin supports having multiple `UploadLocations` configured at once, and each UploadLocation can use a different implementation of the `IVirtualFiles` interface.

This can be added in your AppHost Configure method or IHostingStartup ConfigureAppHost method. Each UploadLocation requires a Name string and an instance of an IVirtualFiles provider.

```csharp
var appFs = new FileSystemVirtualFiles(
    ContentRootDirectory.RealPath.CombineWith("App_Data").AssertDir()
);

Plugins.Add(new FilesUploadFeature(
  new UploadLocation("fs", appFs,
      readAccessRole: RoleNames.AllowAnon,
      resolvePath: ResolveUploadPath,
      validateUpload: ValidateUpload,
      validateDownload: ValidateDownload)
));
```

In this example of integrating local file system, we initialize the IVirtualFiles of `FileSystemVirtualFiles`, passing the local file path where you want the uploaded files to be stored.


## Using File Upload Locations in APIs

With just the above configured, we can now use them in our APIs. The `[UploadTo("name")]` attribute is used with an AutoQuery request DTO and related database model class. For example, the `FileSystemFileItem` table contains metadata about file access and is referenced by `FileSystemFile` table which contains our file metadata.

In the `FileBlazor` demo, we store the file metadata in one table which is related back to another to store additional metadata we use to limit file access.

```csharp
public class FileSystemFile
{
    [AutoIncrement]
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string FileName { get; set; }
    
    public string FilePath { get; set; }
    public string ContentType { get; set; }
    
    public long ContentLength { get; set; }
    
    [Reference(typeof(FileSystemFileItem))]
    public int SharedFileId { get; set; }
}

public class FileSystemFileItem
{
    [AutoIncrement]
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public FileAccessType? FileAccessType { get; set; }
    
    [Reference]
    public FileSystemFile AppFile { get; set; }
    [References(typeof(AppUser))]
    public int AppUserId { get; set; }
    
    [Reference]
    public AppUser AppUser { get; set; }
    
    public string RoleName { get; set; }
}
```

The `FileSystemFile` data is populated automatically when a file is uploaded while creating an `FileSystemFileItem`. We apply to `[UploadTo("azure")]` attribute to the `ICreateDb` DTO to the matching type and name for the `FileSystemFile`. The "fs" name matches the UploadLocation we previously configured in the FilesUploadFeature. This is what determines where the upload file is stored.

```csharp
public class CreateFileSystemFileItem : ICreateDb<FileSystemFileItem>, IReturn<FileSystemFileItem>
{
    public FileAccessType? FileAccessType { get; set; }
    public string? RoleName { get; set; }
    
    [Input(Type = "file", UploadTo("fs")]
    public FileSystemFileItem AppFile { get; set; }
{
```

We also apply the `[Input(Type="file")]` attribute to enhance the Locode App so we can upload files directly from the Locode generated user interface.

## Blazor Custom Client Upload

If you need to provide a custom UI, these services accessible from multiple languages since they are HTTP services.

For example, the `FileBlazor` demo provides the ability to drag & drop files to upload. It does this using the ServiceStack JsonApiClient to MultipartFormDataContent which includes the request and the file to upload.

```csharp
async Task UploadFile(InputFileChangeEventArgs e)
{
    var request = new CreateFileSystemFileItem
    {
        FileAccessType = FileAccessType.Private
    };
    
    using var content = new MultipartFormDataContent()
        .AddParams(request);
    
    var file = e.File;
    using var stream = file.OpenReadStream(maxFileSize);
    using var ms = new MemoryStream();
    await stream.CopyToAsync(ms);
    ms.Position = 0;
    content.AddFile("AppFile", file.Name, ms, file.ContentType);
    
    var ap = await jsonApiClient.ApiFormAsync<CreateFileSystemFileItem>(typeof(CreateFileSystemFileItem).ToApiUrl(), content);
    
    if(!api.Succeeded)
        errorStatus = api.Error;
}
```

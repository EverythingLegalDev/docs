title: ServiceStack.Stripe
---

The [ServiceStack.Stripe](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/tree/main/ServiceStack.Stripe) library contains a typed .NET client gateway for accessing [Stripe's REST API](https://stripe.com/docs/api/), updated to the latest **2018-02-28** Stripe API Version available which is used by [servicestack.net](http://servicestack.net/) to process merchant payments and recurring subscriptions online.

This library only maintains the core Stripe REST APIs for processing payments, subscriptions and managing Customer account & card information.
We welcome PR's with support of missing APIs which typically only requires adding annotated C# POCO DTOs as seen below.

## Features

  - **Small**, typed, message-based API uses only clean DTO's and fits in a single [StripeGateway.cs](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/main/ServiceStack.Stripe/src/ServiceStack.Stripe/StripeGateway.cs)
  - **Async** every Stripe Service can be called via either Sync or Async methods
  - **Portable** profile available supporting .NET 4.5, Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Android and Windows Store clients
  - **Open-ended**, can use custom declarative DTO's defined in your own app to access new APIs  
  - **Testable**, implements the mockable [IRestGateway](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack.Interfaces/IRestGateway.cs), can [return test data](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/tests/ServiceStack.Common.Tests/MockRestGatewayTests.cs) with a generic [MockRestGateway](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/blob/master/src/ServiceStack/Testing/MockRestGateway.cs)
  - See [Stripe.Tests](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/tree/main/ServiceStack.Stripe/tests/ServiceStack.Stripe.Tests/Stripe.Tests) for more example usages.

## Install ServiceStack.Stripe

Install from NuGet with:

:::nuget
`<PackageReference Include="ServiceStack.Stripe" Version="6.*" />`
:::

### ASP .NET Core on .NET Framework

To use this library in [ASP.NET Core Apps running on the .NET Framework](http://docs.servicestack.net/templates-corefx), install the **.NET Standard 2.0** only NuGet package instead:

:::nuget
`<PackageReference Include="ServiceStack.Stripe.Core" Version="6.*" />`
:::

## Usage

Requires a [registered Stripe API Key](https://manage.stripe.com/register), e.g:

```csharp
var gateway = new StripeGateway("sk_test_23KlmQohLKD4dfmAvxYESZ2z");
```

Request DTO's are just clean POCO's with `[Route]` attributes defined, e.g:

```csharp
[Route("/customers/{Id}")]
public class GetStripeCustomer : IGet, IReturn<StripeCustomer>
{
    public string Id { get; set; }
}
```

The `IGet` interface marker indicates which HTTP Method Stripe expects, whilst `IReturn<StripeCustomer>` indicates what Stripe returns. 
The gateway uses this type information to provide its typed API, e.g:

```csharp
StripeCustomer customer = gateway.Get(new GetStripeCustomer { Id = customerId });
```

#### Async

```csharp
StripeCustomer customer = await gateway.GetAsync(new GetStripeCustomer { Id = customerId });
```

If you prefer, you can use the same `gateway.Send()` generic method for **all** messages as it is able to make use of 
the `IVerb` interface marker to control which HTTP method is used, e.g.

```csharp
StripeCustomer customer = gateway.Send(new GetStripeCustomer { Id = customerId });
```

#### Async

```csharp
StripeCustomer customer = await gateway.SendAsync(new GetStripeCustomer { Id = customerId });
```

Both of these calls translates to the [Retrieving a Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api/curl#retrieve_customer) HTTP Request, Example in curl:

:::sh
curl https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers/cus_3552jPRgtQeRcK -u yDOr26HsxyhpuRB3qbG07qfCmDhqutnA:
:::

### Open-Ended, Declarative Message-based APIs

The `StripeGateway` benefits from an **Open Ended** message-based API where you're also able to use own Request DTO's to call new Stripe Services that StripeGateway has no knowledge about. E.g. The only custom code required to implement the `ChargeStripeCustomer` is this single, clean, declarative Request DTO:

```csharp
[Route("/charges")]
public class ChargeStripeCustomer : IPost, IReturn<StripeCharge>
{
    public int Amount { get; set; }
    public string Currency { get; set; }
    public string Customer { get; set; }
    public string Card { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
    public bool? Capture { get; set; }
    public int? ApplicationFee { get; set; }
}
```  

Which contains all the information needed to call the Stripe Service including the `/charges` relative url, using the **POST** HTTP method and the typed `StripeCharge` DTO it returns. To charge a Customer the Request DTO can either use the explicit `Post/PostAsync` or universal `Send/SendAsync` StripeGateway methods. 

## Documentation

These API examples follows [Stripe's API Documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/).

## [Charges](https://stripe.com/docs/api/curl#charges)

### Creating a new charge (charging a credit card)

```csharp
var charge = gateway.Post(new ChargeStripeCustomer
{
    Amount = 100,
    Customer = customer.Id,
    Currency = "usd",
    Description = "Test Charge Customer",
});
```

#### Async

```csharp
var charge = await gateway.PostAsync(new ChargeStripeCustomer
{
    Amount = 100,
    Customer = customer.Id,
    Currency = "usd",
    Description = "Test Charge Customer",
});
```

### Retrieving a Charge


```csharp
var charge = gateway.Get(new GetStripeCharge { ChargeId = charge.Id });
```

### Updating a Charge


```csharp
var charge = gateway.Post(new UpdateStripeCharge

    Capture = false,  //Don't capture the charge immediately
});

//Can capture charge later with an explicit call

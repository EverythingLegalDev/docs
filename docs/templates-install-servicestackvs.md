title: Install ServiceStackVS
---

First we want to install [ServiceStackVS Visual Studio extension](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/5bd40817-0986-444d-a77d-482e43a48da7). The easiest way to do this is to look for it from within Visual Studio by going to Tools->Extensions and Updates and searching the Visual Studio Gallery as seen below.

Optionally it can be downloaded and installed from the [VS.NET Gallery](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/5bd40817-0986-444d-a77d-482e43a48da7)

### Visual Studio 2013-2017

If you're still using VS.NET 2017, 2015 or 2013 you can use the earlier VS.NET ServiceStackVS extension:

- [ServiceStackVS for 2013-2015](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStackVS/raw/master/dist/2018/ServiceStackVS.vsix)
- [ServiceStackVS 2.0 for 2015-2019](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStackVS/raw/master/dist/2021/ServiceStackVS.vsix)

::: info
A limited selection of .NET Framework project templates can also be created inside VS.NET using the previous version of
[ServiceStackVS VS.NET Extension](https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStackVS/raw/master/dist/2021/ServiceStackVS.vsix), however these templates are no longer updated.
